# Underwater Gardening
Spreadable blocks (Grass Blocks) now ignore water that is above them, making them survive and spread underwater. 

This is a Server-Side mod! (still works in singleplayer of course)

## Keep in mind:
**Blocks (for example: Grass Blocks) may need Light to spread, and water reduces light levels!**

So place down some light sources.
